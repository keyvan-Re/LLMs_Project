    "overall_history": "Jorge, an 8-year-old Spanish-speaking boy diagnosed with Autism, lives in the Northwestern U.S. with his parents and older sister Carmen. Initially dependent on spoon-feeding and in diapers, Jorge progressed through toilet training, independent eating, and functional communication. Key challenges included echolalia, resistance to school cooperation, and escape behaviors during tasks. Through structured reinforcement and family involvement, he achieved daytime toileting, 15 functional words, and faster mealtimes. His sister became an active part of the intervention, and the family expressed concern about long-term relapse, leading to planned follow-ups and home data collection.",
